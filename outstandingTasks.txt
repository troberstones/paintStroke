1 - Make tilt information accessable to shader
    a - needs to be conveted to float by dividing by 60 values are -60 - 60 in x
    and y
       - i - check tilt info
       - ii - check that it is passed to the strokeDB
        iii - check that the conversion to costheta and verticalness is working
        iv - Figuure out how to mix between explars of strokes.
         v - figure out how to determine side stroke vs perp stroke.

2 - Make interface to choose color
    add a uniform value for the color of the stroke
    use the paint map as the alpha
3 - Add stroke interpolation
    a - base on hand and tape method, with fixed steps to reach target position
    b - target strength is based on the speed of the stroke
    c - changing directions also increase the attraction to the point
